> This study proposed an automatic pancreatic cancer cell recognition system utilizing a deep convolutional neural network and quantitative images of lipid droplets (LDs) from stain-free cytologic samples through optical diffraction tomography. We retrieved 3D refractive index tomograms, reconstructing 37 optical images per cell. Additionally, we employed various machine learning techniques within a single image-based prediction model to enhance the computer-aided diagnostic system's performance.
